Budget Buddy is a small budget assistant app that runs in the terminal.
It has two operating modes. The first Shopping Mode, in this mode you tell Budget Buddy your budget and shopping list, including items and prices.
Then it will get a total of your list plus tax and let you knoow if you're Over or Under Budget!
The second is Sales Tax Mode. In this mode, you input an item price and Budget Buddy will give you the total plus tax.
